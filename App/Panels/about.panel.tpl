		<h1>How City Budgets Work</h1>

		<p>You can think of a typical city budget as a flow of funds, not unlike your own personal finances. You have income, bank accounts, and expenses. A city has revenue, funds, and expenditures.</p>

		<p>A city's revenue comes in the form of taxes and fees. That revenue is organized into funds, upon which specific departments, divisions, and city programs can draw for their expendictures. Funds and departments have their own hierarchical structures. For example, the Refuse Fund, the Electric Fund, the Gas Fund, and others are all grouped together under the category of Enterprise Funds. Departments are broken down into divisions (sometimes called programs). For example, The City Attorney Department has an Administrative division, a Consultation and Advisory division, and others.</p>

		<p>A division or program (and hence the department to which it belongs) can draw on multiple funds; similarly, the same revenue stream can feed into multiple funds.</p>

		<p>Moreover, a city's various departments have the same types of expenditures. For example, departments spend money on salaries and benefits for their employees (which is the largest city expenditure category). This allows a budget to offer an additional perspective on a city's finances: how much money is being spent on various categories of expenditures, instead of a breakdown merely by department, division, or program.</p>

		<h1>How to use Delphi Budgets</h1>

		<p>Delphi Budgets offers the ability to explore a budget in a simple graphical user interface, making it easier than pouring through hundreds of pages of a budget document to get at the information you want about your city's finances.</p>

		<p>The interface is organized into two main panels. The panel on the left contains two columns--one for Fund and the other for Department--that allows you to select the data you want to see in the right panel, which contains the resulting graph.</p>

		<p>Because of the relationship between funds and departments, the two columns on the left filter one another as you make selections, indicating which departments recieve money from which funds, or, conversely, which funds grant money to which departments. You can select a fund first or a department first--it all depends on what information you need.</p>

		<p>As you make selections, you'll notice the graph in the right panel updating. You'll also see a few different options for displaying the data.</p>

		<p>Above the graph, you'll notice that you can break down the data in different ways. There are several options for viewing financial data, and if you've only selected a department, you can view employee data. Financial breakdowns are by fund (showing how much money is spent out of each fund), department (showing how much money is spent by each department), expenditure (showing how much money is spent in each expenditure category type), revenue (showing how much money is taken in), fee revenue (showing how much money is taken in in the form of non-tax fees), and expenditure versus revenue. Employee breakdowns include number of employees by what department (or division) they are in, number of employees by each type of employee, and salary of each employee type.</p>

		<p>You can also choose different graph types. There are the traditional pie and line charts, as well as a stacked (or area) chart to illustrate each component's contribution to the total, in both absolute numbers and percentages.</p>
